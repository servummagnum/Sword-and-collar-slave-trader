It's can be hard to tell what i should and shouldn't translate, so if i missed anything or something breaks, please let me know. I suspect a lot of movement options are not translated, but I don't know for sure until someone finds them and lets me know. Good rule of thumb, save often at least until a play test can be finished.

Square brackets "[]" indicate my translator notes if something was hard to translate or uses odd phrasing, or i just wanted to make a comment

The painter sometimes makes explanations in english, and to keep his, extravity, I've put his english exclamations into japenese with square brackets indicating the meaning, and translated his japanese normally

There may be some inconsistencies that are present in the base game: i.e. some items say heal 250 HP, but actually heal 300. So, if you encounter one of these, please let me know, i did my best to catch them, but one might have sliped through

I was drunk while translating some of this, so if something isn't translated well, let me know and i'll fix it

Some things, especially combat notifications, are hard to understand looking at the raw text, so if somehing looks off, or says something like, got Potions 23! instead of got 23 Potions!, lmk.
If there is ever a case where something like c[17] shows up, or the text turns black, let me know and I'll fix it

If you see something like [Yuno] at the end of a line, and no name box, please let me know, this is an error caused by the word wrap script
